## Cost Optimization Tips

### For Small Organizations
- Consider disabling provisioned concurrency initially if traffic is very low
- Use shorter log retention periods (3 days instead of 1 week)
- Monitor usage patterns for the first month

### For Medium Organizations
- Current configuration is optimal for consistent performance
- Consider implementing response caching for frequently asked questions
- Monitor guardrail usage patterns

### For Growing Organizations
- Current configuration provides best cost efficiency
- Consider reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Are there any setup costs?
**A:** No setup costs. You only pay for AWS resources used after deployment.

### Q: Can I reduce costs further?
**A:** Yes, you can disable provisioned concurrency for lower traffic scenarios, reduce log retention, or adjust guardrail settings.

### Q: What happens if I exceed the estimates?
**A:** Costs scale linearly with usage. Set up CloudWatch billing alerts to monitor spending.
