    fontSize: '16px',
    borderRadius: '8px'
  }
});
```

### Client-Side Caching

The widget includes client-side caching to reduce API calls for repeated questions. You can customize the caching behavior:

```javascript
SmallBizChatbot.init({
  containerId: 'chatbot-container',
  cache: {
    enabled: true,           // Enable/disable caching
    maxEntries: 20,          // Maximum number of cached responses
    ttl: 3600000             // Time-to-live in milliseconds (1 hour default)
  }
});
```

To clear the cache programmatically:

```javascript
SmallBizChatbot.clearCache();
```

### Response Streaming

The widget supports response streaming for a better user experience. You can enable or disable streaming:

```javascript
SmallBizChatbot.init({
  containerId: 'chatbot-container',
  streaming: true            // Enable/disable streaming
});
```

To toggle streaming programmatically:

```javascript
SmallBizChatbot.setStreamingEnabled(true); // or false
```

### Knowledge Base Management

To update your knowledge base:

1. Add new documents to your documents folder
2. Run the upload script:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.upload_documents --folder ./your-documents-folder
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Amazon Nova Lite Model

This solution uses Amazon Nova Lite, a cost-effective foundation model from AWS that provides high-quality responses while keeping costs low. Nova Lite offers:

- Excellent performance for general knowledge questions
- Good context understanding for RAG applications
- Lower cost compared to larger models
- Fast response times

### WebSocket Streaming

The chatbot supports real-time response streaming through WebSocket connections:

- Responses begin appearing immediately as they're generated
- Uses API Gateway WebSocket API for real-time communication
- Falls back to standard REST API if WebSocket is not available
- Provides better user experience with immediate feedback

### Vector Database

The solution uses PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for efficient similarity search:

- Automatic setup of pgvector extension
- Optimized indexing for fast vector similarity queries
- Supports up to 1536-dimensional embeddings (Amazon Titan)
- Configurable similarity thresholds

### Document Processing Pipeline

Documents are processed automatically when uploaded to S3:

1. **Text Extraction**: Uses Amazon Textract for PDFs and images, direct reading for text files
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts document metadata including title, author, date, and structure
3. **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligently splits documents based on semantic boundaries and structure
4. **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector embeddings using Amazon Titan
5. **Storage**: Stores embeddings and metadata in PostgreSQL with pgvector
6. **Indexing**: Automatically creates vector similarity indexes

#### Advanced Chunking Strategies

The solution implements several advanced chunking strategies:

1. **Structure-Based Chunking**: Uses document headings and sections to create semantically meaningful chunks
2. **Semantic Boundary Detection**: Splits text at natural boundaries like paragraph ends and sentence breaks
3. **Chunk Overlap**: Maintains context between chunks with configurable overlap
4. **Importance Scoring**: Assigns higher importance to chunks with headings, introductions, and conclusions
5. **Metadata Enrichment**: Each chunk includes relevant metadata about its source and context

#### Metadata Extraction

The solution extracts and stores rich metadata from documents:

1. **Document Structure**: Headings, sections, and hierarchical organization
2. **Content Types**: Identifies tables, forms, and special content
3. **Source Information**: Tracks document origin, author, and creation date
4. **File Properties**: Size, type, and modification dates
5. **Custom Attributes**: Supports custom metadata for domain-specific information

### Security Features

The solution implements multiple layers of security:

- **API Key Authentication**: All API requests require valid API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable throttling at API Gateway level
- **WAF Protection**: AWS WAF with managed rule sets and custom rate limiting
- **Content Moderation**: Bedrock Guardrails filter inappropriate content
- **Database Security**: Security groups restrict access to the database
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Credential Rotation**: Automatic database credential rotation every 90 days

### Retry Logic and Error Handling

The Lambda functions include comprehensive error handling:

- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retries with increasing delays
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to cached responses when possible
- **Detailed Logging**: CloudWatch logs for debugging and monitoring

### Bedrock Prompt Caching

The solution leverages Amazon Bedrock's built-in prompt caching feature to reduce costs and improve response times:

- **Automatic Caching**: Identical prompts are cached for 3 days (72 hours)
- **Cost Savings**: You're only charged for the initial model invocation, not for subsequent cached responses
- **Improved Latency**: Cached responses are returned more quickly than generating new responses
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboard tracks cache hit rates and performance metrics

Prompt caching is enabled for both text generation and embedding generation, providing cost savings across all aspects of the solution.

**Expected Cost Savings:**
- Small Business (50 users/day): ~$0.10-0.15/month savings
- Growing Business (150 users/day): ~$0.35-0.50/month savings
- Medium Business (500 users/day): ~$1.40-2.00/month savings

### Provisioned Concurrency

The solution includes optional provisioned concurrency for the chatbot Lambda function only:

- **Eliminates Cold Starts**: Keeps Lambda functions warm and ready to respond
- **Consistent Performance**: Provides predictable response times
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- **Cost-Effective**: Only provisions the minimum needed capacity (default: 1 concurrent execution)
- **Auto-Scaling**: Can scale up to 2x the provisioned capacity during traffic spikes
- **Targeted**: Only applied to chatbot function, not document processor (which doesn't need immediate response)

When enabled, the solution creates a Lambda alias with provisioned concurrency, ensuring immediate response times for chat requests.

**Cost Analysis with Graviton3:**
- **1 concurrent execution**: $0.91/month (60% reduction from x86_64)
- **2 concurrent executions**: $1.83/month (60% reduction from x86_64)
- **Document processor**: No provisioned concurrency (cost-optimized for background processing)

**Usage Recommendations:**
- **Small Business (50 users)**: 1 concurrent execution
- **Growing Business (150 users)**: 1-2 concurrent executions
- **Medium Business (500+ users)**: 2 concurrent executions

### Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations ensure good performance:

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses database connections across Lambda invocations
- **Client-Side Caching**: Reduces API calls for repeated questions
- **CloudFront CDN**: Fast delivery of frontend assets
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient vector similarity searches
- **Memory Configuration**: Right-sized Lambda memory allocation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- View CloudWatch dashboards to monitor usage and performance
- Check CloudWatch Logs for error messages and debugging (logs retained for 7 days)
- Regularly update your knowledge base as information changes
- Monitor costs through AWS Cost Explorer
- Review security logs and WAF metrics

## Security Considerations

- The solution implements rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Content moderation is applied through Bedrock guardrails
- All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- API Gateway protected by AWS WAF
- Database credentials automatically rotated every 90 days
- CloudWatch logs retained for 7 days to minimize exposure
- Database security groups restrict access
- Least privilege IAM roles and policies

### Database Security Group Configuration

The deployment script automatically configures security group rules to allow access from EC2 and Lambda services in the us-east-1 region. This ensures that your Lambda functions can connect to the database while maintaining security.

**Note:** The provided security group rules are specifically for us-east-1 region. If you're deploying to a different region, you'll need to modify the CIDR blocks in the deployment script.

If you need to manually configure these rules, you can use the following AWS CLI commands:

```bash
# Replace sg-xxxxxxxx with your database security group ID
# Replace region with your deployment region

# IPv4 rules for EC2 and Lambda services in us-east-1
# Large blocks
for CIDR in "3.80.0.0/12" "3.208.0.0/12" "3.224.0.0/12" "34.192.0.0/12" "34.224.0.0/12" "44.192.0.0/11" "52.0.0.0/8" "54.0.0.0/8"; do
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
        --group-id sg-xxxxxxxx \
        --protocol tcp \
        --port 5432 \
        --cidr "$CIDR" \
        --region us-east-1
done

# Medium blocks
for CIDR in "13.216.0.0/13" "18.204.0.0/14" "18.208.0.0/13" "23.20.0.0/14" "35.168.0.0/13" "50.16.0.0/15" "98.80.0.0/12" "100.24.0.0/13" "107.20.0.0/14" "174.129.0.0/16" "184.73.0.0/16"; do
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
        --group-id sg-xxxxxxxx \
        --protocol tcp \
        --port 5432 \
        --cidr "$CIDR" \
        --region us-east-1
done

# IPv6 rules
for IPV6_CIDR in "2600:1f00::/24" "2600:f0f0::/28" "2606:f40::/36"; do
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
        --group-id sg-xxxxxxxx \
        --ip-permissions "IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=5432,ToPort=5432,Ipv6Ranges=[{CidrIpv6=$IPV6_CIDR}]" \
        --region us-east-1
done
```

These rules consolidate the numerous IP ranges used by AWS EC2 and Lambda services in us-east-1 into a manageable set of CIDR blocks, reducing the number of security group rules from over 400 to just 22.
