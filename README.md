## üß™ Test Your Chatbot

### Sample Demo Page
After deployment, test your chatbot using the included sample page:

**üìÑ Location**: `src/frontend/index.html`

```bash
# Open the sample page in your browser
open src/frontend/index.html
# or
firefox src/frontend/index.html
# or
chrome src/frontend/index.html
```

**‚ú® Features of the demo page:**
- **Interactive chatbot widget** with your deployed configuration
- **Test controls** to try caching, streaming, and WebSocket features
- **Example questions** to get started
- **Connection status** indicator
- **Performance testing** tools (cache clearing, reconnection)

**üí° Pro tip**: Use this sample page to validate your deployment and test new features before integrating into your website.

## üìö Document Management Commands

### Local Document Processing (Recommended)
Documents are now processed locally with full functionality, then uploaded to S3:

```bash
# Install local processing dependencies
pip install -r requirements-local.txt

# Process a single document
python3 scripts/process_documents_locally.py --file ./my-document.pdf

# Process all documents in a folder
python3 scripts/process_documents_locally.py --folder ./documents

# Process folder recursively (includes subfolders)
python3 scripts/process_documents_locally.py --folder ./documents --recursive

# Process with custom document ID
python3 scripts/process_documents_locally.py --file ./doc.pdf --document-id "my-custom-id"

# Delete a processed document
python3 scripts/process_documents_locally.py --delete "document-id"

# Batch processing mode (faster for multiple files)
python3 scripts/process_documents_locally.py --folder ./documents --batch
```

### Legacy Upload Commands (for compatibility)
```bash
# Upload new documents (uses local processing)
python3 -m scripts.upload_documents --folder ./documents

# Upload a single document
python3 -m scripts.upload_documents --file ./my-document.pdf

# Upload documents in batch mode
python3 -m scripts.upload_documents --folder ./documents --batch
```

### System Management Commands
```bash
# Clean up old vectors (90+ days)
python3 scripts/cleanup_vectors.py --days 90

# Manage vector index for better performance
python3 scripts/manage_vector_indexes.py --rebuild

# View deployment status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ChatbotRagStack

# Check system health
./deploy.sh status

# Rollback deployment if needed
./deploy.sh rollback
```

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling

To completely remove the chatbot and all AWS resources:

```bash
# Quick uninstall (recommended)
./deploy.sh rollback

# For manual uninstall steps, see the complete guide
```
